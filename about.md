Hi, I am a PhD student in the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University. My primary research is in building computational models for user modeling, specifically in language learning. I apply techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Translation (MT), and Machine Learning (ML) towards this problem. In addition, I am working on building models for grammar correction for language learners. Finally, I am interested in studying speed vs. accuracy trade-offs in machine translation and interactive machine translation.

I am advised by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/) and [Jason Eisner](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/). I also have worked with [Adam Lopez](http://alopez.github.io/) on finite automata based systems for machine translation and translation using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR). 

Before joining CLSP, I worked on designing new modalities of user interaction at the [Arts Media & Engineering](https://artsmediaengineering.asu.edu/) program. I also worked at [Rosetta Stone](http://www.rosettastone.com/) as a software developer and did a brief stint as an NLP engineer at [MModal](https://mmodal.com/).
