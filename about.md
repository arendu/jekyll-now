Hi, I am a PhD student in the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University. My primary research is in the inter-disciplinary area of Language Learning. Specifically building computational models for user modeling in the context of language learning. I am also interested in building models for grammar correction for language learners. I also work on Machine Translation; Specifically studying speed Vs. accuracy trade-offs in machine translation and interactive machine translation.

I am advised by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/) and [Jason Eisner](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/). I also have worked with [Adam Lopez](http://alopez.github.io/) on finite automata based systems for machine translation and translation using Abstract Meaning Representations(AMR).
