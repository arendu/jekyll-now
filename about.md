I am a PhD student in the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University. My primary research is in building computational models for user modeling, specifically in language learning. I apply techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Translation (MT), and Machine Learning (ML) towards this problem. 

I am advised by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/) and [Jason Eisner](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/). I also have worked with [Adam Lopez](http://alopez.github.io/) on finite automata based systems for machine translation and translation using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR). I've also worked with [Kevin duh](http://cs.jhu.edu/~kevinduh/) on character-aware NMT modeling as well as an analysis on the effect of Byte-pair encoding on NMT performance. Recently, I've worked on a few projects in End-to-End speech recognition with [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe).

Before joining CLSP, I worked on designing new modalities of user interaction at the [Arts Media & Engineering](https://artsmediaengineering.asu.edu/) program. I also worked at [Rosetta Stone](http://www.rosettastone.com/) as a software developer and did a brief stint as an NLP engineer at [MModal](https://mmodal.com/). See my [CV](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arendu/arendu.github.io/blob/master/images/resume_6_17_2019.pdf) for more details.
