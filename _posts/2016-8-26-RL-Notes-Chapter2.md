### N-Armed Bandits
Definitions:
1. _Value_ of an _action_ is the mean expected reward obtained by performing that action.
Some useful distinctions I found:
[Difference between n-armed-bandit testing and A/B testing](http://conversionxl.com/bandit-tests/)

this is a test
here are some latex equations.
$$ a = b + c + \frac{1}{2}$$

some more eq
\begin{align}
k  &= 2 \times \delta \\\\
&= a + \mathbf{c}
\end{align}

some more eq with align inside double dollar:

$$ \begin{align}
k  &= 2 \times \delta \\
&= a + \mathbf{c}
\end{align} $$
